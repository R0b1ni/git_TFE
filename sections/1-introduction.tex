\section{Introduction}
The preliminary design phase is a crucial step in the development of a new product, as it lays the foundation for the subsequent detailed design and manufacturing processes. This phase involves defining the product's specifications, identifying potential design concepts, and evaluating their feasibility. We will have some constraints to respect, and some design parameters to choose.
\subsection{Input Data}
To start the design, we need to define the constrains of the system.
Therefore, we have the following data imposed.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hauteur de chute $\Delta H = \DeltaH \, \mathrm{m}$
    \item Rayon extérieur $R_o = 0.1 \, \mathrm{m}$
    \item vitesse du fluide $V_x = 2 \, \mathrm{m/s}$
    \item rendement hydraulique théorique maximal $\eta = \etar $
\end{itemize}
