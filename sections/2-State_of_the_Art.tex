\section{State of the Art}
In this section, we will first try to aknowledge the cases of applpication of our project to see which types of solutions could be implemented. Then, we will
review the state of the art in the field of turbine blade design, with a focus on Kaplan turbines. We will discuss the various methods and approaches that have been proposed in the literature for designing efficient and effective turbine blades. We will also explore the low-tech aspects of turbine design, such as the use of local materials and simple manufacturing techniques.
